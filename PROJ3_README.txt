For my implementation I cover the following cases
	- class
	- struct
	- enums
	- typedefs
	- aliases
	- namespaces
	
I cover the following special cases:
	- Global Functions
	- Namespace with :: (e.g.    NAMESPACE::X x)
	
IMPORTANT
I am using Dr Fawcett's Tokenizer and his solutions exceeds maximum Cyclomatic Complexity and LineCount.
So please don't penalize me for Dr. Fawcett's Tokenizer's CC and line count issues.
